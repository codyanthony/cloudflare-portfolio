# Portfolio Content Style Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures portfolio content reads as natural human prose, not AI-generated text. Apply these rules to all case studies, documentation samples, and portfolio pages.

## Core Principles

1. Write conversationally, as if explaining to a colleague
2. Show through concrete examples, don't just tell
3. Use formatting sparingly and strategicalRely
4. Vary sentence structure and length
5. Be specific over impressive

## Formatting Rules

### Prohibited Structures

- ❌ **Em dashes (—) for sentence breaks**
- ❌ **Informal hyphens (-) for dramatic pauses**
- ❌ **Negative dramatic openings** ("This wasn't just...")
- ❌ **Quotation marks for emphasis** (creates ambiguity, appears unprofessional)
- ❌ **Excessive lists** (use only when significantly improving readability)
- ❌ **Decorative icons** (use only when adding value)
- ❌ **Bold for emphasis** (use only for scannability)

**Examples of what NOT to do:**

```markdown
❌ This wasn't just a feature launch - it was a fundamental shift
❌ • Created comprehensive documentation
• Developed robust solutions
• Implemented seamless workflows
❌ **Key Point:** This is important (bold for emphasis)
```

**Better approaches:**

```markdown
✅ The feature launch represented a fundamental shift in product strategy.
✅ I created documentation, developed solutions, and implemented workflows
that reduced deployment time.
✅ This mattered because customers needed faster deployment paths.
```

## AI-Tell Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Transition Word Overload

**Avoid:** Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover, In addition, Consequently, Subsequently

**Instead:** Use varied connectors or let ideas flow naturally

- "This approach enabled..." (direct causation)
- "The team needed..." (natural progression)
- Simple "and" or start new sentences

**Example:**

- ❌ "Additionally, I developed documentation. Furthermore, I created help content."
- ✅ "I developed documentation and created contextual help content."

### 2. Qualifying Phrase Overuse

**Avoid overusing:** particularly, significantly, especially, notably, specifically, critically

**Use sparingly** and only when the qualification genuinely matters

**Example:**

- ❌ "This was particularly important because it significantly impacted the critically important user experience."
- ✅ "This mattered because it shaped the user experience customers would encounter daily."

### 3. "It's Worth Noting" Constructions

**Avoid:**

- It's important to note that
- It's worth mentioning
- It should be noted
- One thing to highlight

**Instead:** Just state the fact directly

**Example:**

- ❌ "It's worth noting that the documentation addressed customer pain points."
- ✅ "The documentation addressed pain points customers raised in support tickets."

### 4. Adjective Stacking and Dramatic Language

**Avoid adjectives overused by AI:** comprehensive, robust, seamless, innovative, strategic

**Avoid dramatic/hyperbolic language:** crisis, critical, crucial, vital, essential, pivotal, game-changing, revolutionary

**Use:** Specific, concrete descriptors or let actions speak

**Why avoid dramatic language:** These words inflate importance and sound marketing-like rather than professional. State the situation directly without hyperbole.

**Examples:**

- ❌ "I created a comprehensive, robust documentation system that provided seamless integration."
- ✅ "I created documentation that integrated with the console workflow, providing guidance at each deployment step."

- ❌ "When data revealed the DNS validation crisis..."
- ✅ "When data revealed the DNS validation issue..."

- ❌ "This was a critical deployment barrier"
- ✅ "This was a deployment barrier" OR "This was a significant deployment barrier"

- ❌ "The most critical customer feedback point"
- ✅ "High-priority customer feedback" OR "Important customer feedback"

### 5. Formulaic Sentence Patterns

**Avoid:** Too many sentences with identical structure

**Repetitive (❌):**

```
I developed the console UI.
I created the documentation.
I designed the help content.
I coordinated with stakeholders.
```

**Varied (✅):**

```
I developed console UI text while creating user documentation in parallel.
Help content provided contextual guidance, and I coordinated review cycles
with product and engineering stakeholders.
```

### 6. Gerund Sentence Starters

**Avoid starting every sentence with -ing words**

- ❌ "Working with the team, I... Collaborating across functions, I... Developing the content, I..."
- ✅ Mix structures: "I worked with the team to... Collaboration across functions enabled... The content development process involved..."

### 7. Passive Voice Overuse

**Prefer active voice** for clarity and directness

- ❌ "Documentation was created that addressed user needs."
- ✅ "I created documentation addressing user needs."

**Use passive only when:**

- Actor is unknown/irrelevant
- Focusing on the action/result: "The feature was launched in May 2023"

### 8. Repetitive Key Phrase Hammering

**Avoid repeating the same phrase for emphasis** (AI does this for SEO)

- ❌ "...unified product experience. The unified product experience enabled... By creating a unified product experience..."
- ✅ Use varied language: "...unified product experience. This integration enabled... By connecting console and documentation..."

**Specific overused phrases to use sparingly:**

- "from scratch" - Use once or twice maximum per case study. Alternatives: "developed new content", "built", "created"
- "end-to-end" - Often vague and overused
- "ground up" - Similar to "from scratch"

**Example:**

- ❌ "I created console UI from scratch. I developed help panels from scratch. I built documentation from scratch."
- ✅ "I created console UI, developed help panels, and built comprehensive documentation for this new console experience."

### 9. Clichéd Conclusions

**Avoid:**

- In conclusion
- Ultimately
- At the end of the day
- In summary
- To sum up

**Instead:** Just state the takeaway or impact

- ❌ "In conclusion, this project demonstrated the value of..."
- ✅ "This project established cross-company collaboration patterns that became the template for future releases."

### 10. Excessive "I" Sentence Starts

**Vary sentence subjects**

- ❌ "I developed the content. I reviewed the designs. I coordinated the stakeholders."
- ✅ "I developed content through weekly design reviews with product and UX teams. Stakeholder coordination involved..."

### 11. Over-Explanation

**AI tends to explain everything. Humans assume some context.**

- ❌ "I participated in weekly design workshops, which are collaborative sessions where team members meet to discuss and iterate on design decisions, in order to provide feedback on UI text."
- ✅ "Weekly design workshops with PM, UX, and console dev teams enabled iterative refinement of UI text and help content."

### 12. Number/Metric Inflation

**Be specific, but don't force metrics everywhere**

- ❌ "I conducted 24 review sessions over 6 months with 8 stakeholders across 3 teams..."
- ✅ "Six months of weekly reviews with product, UX, and engineering stakeholders..."

### 13. Absolute Claims and Unverifiable Statements

**Avoid claims you cannot defend if questioned**

Absolutes like "completely," "entirely," "seamlessly," "without any," "zero," "never" are risky and often indefensible.

**Examples of problematic absolutes:**

- ❌ "Documentation completely eliminated support engagement"
- ❌ "UI text guided customers seamlessly through the workflow"
- ❌ "Content prevented customer confusion"
- ❌ "Process reduced friction to zero"

**Better (defensible) alternatives:**

- ✅ "Documentation supported independent deployment"
- ✅ "Clear UI text guided customers through the workflow"
- ✅ "Unified messaging reduced cognitive load"
- ✅ "Process reduced customer friction"

**Frame positively rather than negatively:**

- ❌ "Prevented confusion" (implies you know confusion didn't occur)
- ✅ "Reduced cognitive load" (describes what you did accomplish)

**If you can't measure it, soften the claim:**

- ❌ "Without requiring support engagement" (you don't have support ticket data)
- ✅ "Supported independent deployment" (describes capability you created)

**Ask yourself:** "If a reviewer asks 'How do you know?', can I answer with evidence?"

- If yes → claim is defensible
- If no → soften the language

### 14. Confidential Information and Unnecessary Specificity

**Protect confidential business data and avoid extraneous details**

Portfolio content must not disclose confidential business information from quarterly summaries, internal meetings, or private communications.

**Prohibited disclosures:**

- ❌ Specific business metrics ("16% success rate", "84% failure rate", "$2M revenue")
- ❌ Team member full names (use roles instead: "EVS PM" not "Kiran Sundar")
- ❌ Internal organizational structure ("AWS Commercial Apps vertical")
- ❌ Internal code names or project names
- ❌ Exact dates unless specifically meaningful (use quarters instead)
- ❌ Meeting scheduling details (times, specific days: "Monday 9:45-10:45am")

**Better alternatives:**

- ✅ "Early customer testing revealed deployment challenges" (instead of exact percentages)
- ✅ "EVS PMs" or "product leadership" (instead of names)
- ✅ "Business and product leadership" (instead of org structure)
- ✅ "Internal project names"
- ✅ "Q2 2025" instead of "June 9, 2025"
- ✅ "Weekly workshops" instead of "Monday 9:45-10:45am meetings"

**When exact dates ARE appropriate:**

- Product launch quarters when publicly announced
- General timeframes (2024-2025, Q2 2023)
- Year ranges showing project duration

**When names ARE appropriate:**

- Published authors on public documentation
- Public conference speakers
- Publicly announced leadership

**General principle:** If information appears in quarterly summaries, internal meetings, or private communications, abstract it for external portfolio use.

## What DOES Sound Human

### Natural Patterns

**1. Sentence Variety**
Mix short and long. Mix structures. Use fragments occasionally for emphasis.

```
The challenge was clear. Customers struggled with complex deployment workflows
that required both AWS and VMware knowledge. Without contextual help, they spent
hours troubleshooting. Unacceptable for a service promising 10-minute cluster creation.
```

**2. Specific Details**
"Redesigned the prerequisites page" > "Created a comprehensive prerequisites solution"

**3. Admitting Constraints**
"Given the cross-company complexity..." (humans acknowledge trade-offs)

**4. Personal Voice**
Occasional first-person opinion: "I recognized that..." or "This approach made sense because..."

**5. Conversational Asides**
"The billing model (using AWS Marketplace) required..."

**6. Concrete Examples**
Show don't tell: Give specific before/after, not just "improved clarity"

## Writing Process to Sound Human

### Step 1: Write Naturally First

Don't try to sound impressive. Just explain what happened.

### Step 2: Remove AI Tells

- Delete transition words that aren't needed
- Cut adjective stacks
- Vary sentence starts
- Remove "it's worth noting" constructions

### Step 3: Add Specifics

Replace vague with concrete. "Created documentation" → "Created a 12-page getting started guide"

### Step 4: Read Aloud

If it sounds like a corporate press release, it's too AI. Should sound like explaining to a colleague.
