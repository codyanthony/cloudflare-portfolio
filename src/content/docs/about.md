description: Senior Technical Writer specializing in API documentation, architecture guides, and developer experience
---

I'm a Senior Technical Writer with 8+ years of experience creating documentation for cloud infrastructure, developer tools, and enterprise software. I specialize in API documentation, technical architecture guides, console UX microcopy, and documentation systems that scale quality across organizations.

## Core Competencies

**API Documentation & Developer Experience**

- REST API reference documentation with comprehensive parameter coverage
- API reference documentation serving as source material for SDK docs and CLI tools
- API design participation shaping parameter names and validation rules
- Developer-focused error messages and troubleshooting guides

**Technical Architecture & System Documentation**

- Network architecture documentation (BGP routing, VPC configuration, hybrid cloud)
- Deployment and getting started guides for complex infrastructure
- Security and compliance documentation
- Architectural constraint and limitation documentation

**Console UX & Microcopy**

- Console help text and field labels
- Error message design and validation guidance
- Tooltips and in-app documentation
- Cross-product terminology alignment

**Documentation Systems & Strategy**

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) content strategy and information architecture
- Documentation infrastructure modernization
- Self-service authoring frameworks and contributor enablement
- AI-assisted documentation workflows

## Tools & Technologies

**Formats & Standards**

- AsciiDoc, Markdown, DITA/DocBook XML
- JSON, YAML syntax documentation

**Platforms & Technologies**

- Kubernetes/OpenShift container orchestration
- VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)
- AWS cloud services and infrastructure
- REST APIs
- IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation)

**Developer Tools**

- Git, GitHub version control
- Python scripting and automation
- CI/CD pipelines for documentation (AWS CodePipeline, AWS Amplify, and proprietary build systems)
- AI assistants (Claude via Cline, Amazon Q Developer, ChatGPT, Gemini)

**Methodologies**

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework
- Information architecture (IA) design
- Docs-as-Code workflows
- Docs-as-Product approach
- Agile documentation practices
- Voice-of-Customer (VOC) analysis

## Industries & Audiences

**Cloud Infrastructure** - Hybrid cloud solutions, container platforms, virtualization, networking

**Developer Tools** - APIs, SDKs, CLIs, infrastructure automation, developer experience

**Enterprise Software** - IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS platforms, enterprise deployments, compliance and security

**Target Audiences** - Software developers, DevOps engineers, cloud architects, system administrators, VMware administrators

## Professional Approach

I embed with Product and Engineering teams early in the development cycle, treating documentation as product feedback rather than a downstream task. This upstream participation allows me to influence API design, console UX, and product decisions before they become documentation challenges.

I also leverage a background in Instructional Design to optimize information architecture and reduce cognitive load. This pedagogical foundation is critical for:

- Developer Experience (DX): Structuring "Zero-to-Hello-World" paths that respect how developers actually learn.

- AI & LLM Training: Creating highly structured, unambiguous datasets and examples that serve as high-quality ground truth for AI models.

My work focuses on measurable outcomes: reducing support tickets through clear error messages, improving time-to-first-success with tested examples, and enabling self-service through comprehensive reference documentation.
