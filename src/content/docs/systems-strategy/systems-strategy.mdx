title: Documentation Systems & Strategy
description: Infrastructure modernization and scalable documentation frameworks enabling self-service authoring and AI-ready workflows
---

Beyond individual deliverables, I've led documentation infrastructure initiatives that enable self-service authoring, improve content quality at scale, and prepare documentation systems for emerging AI workflows. This work demonstrates strategic thinking about documentation as infrastructure—building systems that reduce operational overhead while improving accessibility for both human contributors and large language models (LLMs).

## Approach & Philosophy

I approach documentation systems work with an infrastructure-first mindset, recognizing that the right tooling and frameworks can transform how teams create and maintain content. Rather than forcing adoption organization-wide, I pilot solutions with strategic early adopters, prove value through measurable outcomes, and let organic adoption drive scaling.

**Key principles:**

- **Lower contribution barriers:** Lightweight markup formats accessible to engineers, product managers, and AI-assisted workflows
- **Strategic adoption:** Pilot with willing teams, demonstrate value, enable voluntary expansion
- **Self-service enablement:** Build frameworks that let teams without dedicated writer support maintain quality content
- **AI-readiness positioning:** Infrastructure choices that support both human authoring and LLM consumption
- **Scalable frameworks:** Reusable patterns, automation, and tooling that reduce conversion time and maintenance overhead

This work spans format modernization, content strategy frameworks, and cross-functional coordination systems that prepare documentation infrastructure for the next generation of authoring workflows.

## Featured Projects

These detailed case studies demonstrate the depth of systems thinking and measurable impact on organizational documentation practices:

### [AsciiDoc Modernization Program](/systems-strategy/adoc-modernization/)

Multi-year initiative establishing AsciiDoc as a lightweight documentation format across multiple AWS service teams. Started with ROSA in 2022, expanded to enable EKS external contributions, pioneered self-service models for lean engineering teams, and scaled to specialized air-gapped documentation sets.

**Impact:**

- Reduced conversion time from days to hours through automation
- Self-service models established for teams without dedicated writer support
- Framework voluntarily adopted across multiple service teams
- Documentation infrastructure positioned for AI-assisted workflows with lightweight format more accessible to LLM processing.

### [ROSA Jobs-to-be-Done Content Redesign](/systems-strategy/rosa-jtbd-redesign/)

Multi-year strategic initiative transforming feature-centric ROSA documentation into workflow-based customer journeys. Conducted comprehensive content audit in Q1 2022, maintained strategic vision through active feature-launch phase, then executed restructuring in a two-week sprint to align with broader organizational standards regarding workflow-centric content.

**Impact:**

- Reduced support ticket volume for deployment workflows
- Better customer success rates for first cluster deployments

## Additional Strategic Work

Beyond major initiatives, I've built documentation systems and processes that improve team efficiency and cross-functional alignment:

**Launch readiness frameworks:**

- Created intake processes ensuring documentation delivery aligned with release timelines
- Developed roadmaps and cross-functional coordination systems
- Established shared processes for AWS and external partner launches

**Cross-functional coordination:**

- Built documentation team processes for AWS and external partner collaboration
- Established weekly sync cadences, shared project management tooling integration
- Created visibility mechanisms positioning documentation input in upstream architectural decisions

## Methodology & Tools

**Strategic frameworks:**

- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) content strategy
- Pilot-driven adoption approach
- Incremental scaling through demonstrated value

**Technical implementation:**

- AsciiDoc lightweight markup format
- Python transformation scripts for automated conversion
- AI-assisted workflows (Claude coding assistant, Cline)
- Git-based docs-as-code workflows
- Automated validation and review gates

**Collaboration approach:**

- Early stakeholder alignment through strategic documentation
- Cross-company coordination (AWS and Red Hat)
- Platform engineering partnerships for tooling improvements
- Knowledge transfer through workshops and runbooks
