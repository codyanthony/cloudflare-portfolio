## Senior Technical Writer

8+ years in technical communication, with a deep specialization in cloud infrastructure, developer tools, and enterprise software. I design API reference documentation, architecture guides, and documentation systems that scale.

**Current focus:** Kubernetes/OpenShift, AWS services, IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation), Docs-as-Code, AI-assisted workflows

## Approach

I embed with Product and Engineering teams early in development, treating documentation as product feedback. This upstream participation allows me to influence API design, console UX, and product decisions before they become documentation challenges.

**Measurable outcomes:** Reducing support tickets through clear error messages · Improving time-to-first-success with tested examples · Enabling self-service through comprehensive reference documentation
