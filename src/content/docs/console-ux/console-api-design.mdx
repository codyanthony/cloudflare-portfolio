title: Design Influence & Upstream Collaboration
description: Shaping product experience before documentation through early embedded participation
---

Throughout my work on ROSA and Amazon EVS, I embedded with product and engineering teams early in development cycles to influence console UX, API design, and product decisions before documentation plans were finalized. This upstream participation allowed me to act as a customer experience advocate in design discussions, surface friction points before they became documentation challenges, and contribute cross-service insights that informed integration strategies.

By treating documentation as product feedback rather than a downstream task, I helped shape experiences that reduced customer friction and operational overhead. This approach demonstrated that technical writers bring valuable perspective to product design when engaged early in the development lifecycle.

## Approach & Philosophy

I participate in weekly design workshops with product managers, UX designers, and console developers to review Figma mockups and provide feedback on UI workflows. During these sessions, I identify opportunities to improve customer experience through clearer UI text, better information architecture, and more intuitive workflows. I also leverage cross-service operational knowledge to inform design decisions, sharing learnings from one product team with another to accelerate development and prevent repeated friction patterns.

My upstream work spans multiple surfaces: console UI text and help panels, API parameter naming and validation messaging, error response structures, and product integration strategies. This embedded approach enables me to create more effective documentation because I understand the design rationale behind product decisions and have already surfaced customer experience concerns during development.

## Featured Projects

These detailed case studies demonstrate the depth of upstream collaboration and its impact on product quality:

### [ROSA with Hosted Control Planes Console Integration](/console-ux/rosa-hcp-console-integration/)

Designed console UI microcopy, help panel content, and comprehensive user documentation for new AWS Marketplace billing model launched in Q2 2023. Collaborated with AWS and Red Hat product teams to standardize terminology and design workflows for both Classic and HCP deployment models.

**Impact:** Integrated console UI and documentation reduced customer friction in AWS Marketplace billing workflows. Clear help content enabled customers to choose between HCP and Classic deployment models and complete independent cluster deployment.

### [EVS Day 1 Deployment Experience](/console-ux/evs-day1-deployment/)

Created help panels and console UI text for net-new console experience supporting VMware Cloud Foundation deployment. Collaborated with product and engineering teams to surface network configuration requirements earlier in workflow, preventing mid-deployment validation errors.

**Impact:** Reduced deployment failures through coordinated console validation improvements and documentation. DNS hostname validation addressed a primary source of configuration friction, enabling self-service deployment for VMware administrators.

### [ROSA Prerequisites Automation](/console-ux/rosa-prerequisites-automation/)

Designed console prerequisites automation workflow and supporting documentation enabling customers to verify account readiness before cluster deployment. Created UI text, help content, and validation messaging for automated prerequisites checking.

**Impact:** Eliminated manual prerequisite verification across multiple consoles. Automated Service Quotas checking and IAM permissions validation reduced time-to-first-cluster and created AWS-native enablement path.

### [Cross-Service Service Quotas Strategy](/console-ux/cross-service-service-quotas/)

Shared operational learnings from prior managed service implementations with EVS team during their integration planning. Facilitated discussions on automation benefits and recommended standard Service Quotas API integration approach.

**Impact:** Influenced EVS adoption of standard Service Quotas API integration and customer-friendly quota defaults, enabling self-service quota increases and reducing anticipated support overhead.

### [HCX API Design Collaboration](/console-ux/evs-hcx-api-design/)

Participated in API design reviews as customer experience advocate during HCX feature development. Surfaced parallel VPC work that informed API architecture and contributed to discussions on extensible design patterns aligned with AWS API standards.

**Impact:** Extensible API architecture reduced customer integration churn by enabling future capabilities without breaking changes. Standards-aligned design provided consistent patterns familiar to AWS developers building on EVS.

## Additional Design Contributions

Beyond major projects, I contributed targeted improvements across multiple product surfaces:

**Console & workflow design:**

- Network prerequisites visibility: Advocated for surfacing VPC Route Server requirements on first screen rather than buried in navigation, preventing mid-deployment validation errors
- Cost presentation clarity: Proposed receipt-style format with table structure for ROSA contract flow, improving customer understanding of pricing

**API & parameter design:**

- Parameter naming clarity: Influenced parameter names like `serviceAccessSubnetId` to make purpose self-evident without requiring paragraph explanations
- Mutual exclusivity documentation: Identified parameters that couldn't be used together (e.g., `dedicatedHostId` and `placementGroupId`) for upfront API documentation
- Validation constraint documentation: Ensured CIDR block size limits (`/28` to `/24`) documented in parameter descriptions, not just error messages, enabling correct planning upfront

**Error messaging & validation:**

- Error message improvements: Replaced vague errors like "Invalid CIDR block" with specific guidance: "CIDR block must be between /28 and /24"
- Validation timing optimization: Advocated for earlier validation surfacing to prevent mid-workflow errors

**Terminology & consistency:**

- Cross-company terminology coordination: Aligned ROSA terminology across AWS and Red Hat product surfaces (console, documentation) and influenced upstream OpenShift Container Platform documentation updates, maintaining consistency while managing dependencies to prevent breaking changes
- Cross-service VLAN terminology standardization: Coordinated EVS and VPC team alignment on VLAN terminology strategy, influencing VPC API reference and documentation updates to ensure cohesive narrative across dependent services for both VMware and AWS audiences

## Collaboration Approach

**Methods & tools:**

- Weekly UX design workshops with product, design, and development teams
- Figma mockup review and design feedback
- Cross-service operational insights and knowledge transfer
- Customer experience advocacy in API and console design discussions
- Technical review coordination with product and engineering stakeholders

**Key principle:** Embed early, contribute often, and treat documentation expertise as design input rather than post-launch cleanup.
