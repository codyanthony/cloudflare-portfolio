This project demonstrates coordinated console automation and getting started documentation for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), a managed service for deploying containerized applications with Red Hat OpenShift on AWS. I created automated prerequisite validation wizard UI text, help panels, and comprehensive AWS getting started documentation as components of a cohesive Day 1 enablement experience, shipping with console launch in Q4 2022.

The work addressed two customer friction points: lack of AWS-native getting started documentation and manual prerequisite verification requiring navigation across multiple AWS consoles. I participated in weekly design workshops with PM, UX Designer, Console Developer, and Front-End Engineer through Q4 2022, while creating getting started documentation in parallel through Q3 2022. I also collaborated with Red Hat writers to ensure terminology consistency across both AWS and Red Hat documentation platforms.

## The Challenge

### Closing the Gap Between Customer Expectations and Reality

The primary challenge was manual prerequisite verification. Customers had to discover prerequisite requirements through documentation, then manually check their AWS accounts across multiple consoles for Service Quotas, IAM roles, and ELB service-linked roles. This process provided no proactive visibility into account readiness, leading to deployment failures discovered late in the process when customers had already invested significant time.

Compounding this automation gap, AWS lacked native getting started documentation for ROSA. All Day 0 and Day 1 documentation lived exclusively on Red Hat's documentation site. ROSA customers, accustomed to finding prerequisite and deployment information in AWS service user guides on docs.aws.amazon.com, encountered navigation friction when forced to look elsewhere. This positioning confusion made ROSA appear less integrated as an AWS-native service than customers expected.

**Technical complexity spanning multiple AWS services:**

- Service Quotas: EC2 instance limits, EBS volume quotas (gp2/gp3), Elastic IP limits
- IAM: Account roles, trust policies, permissions
- ELB: Service-linked roles for load balancer management
- AWS Marketplace: Contract enablement requirements

**Customer impact:**
Time-consuming prerequisite hunting across Red Hat and AWS resources created friction. Customers switching between AWS console and Red Hat documentation experienced confusion about where to find authoritative information. ROSA's positioning as an AWS-native service became less clear when customers couldn't find deployment documentation on AWS platforms. Higher support overhead resulted from preventable deployment failures.

## My Approach

### Cross-Functional Workshops and Parallel Content Development

This work spanned both console automation and documentation creation. While the PM and UX Designer developed console functionality, I participated in weekly design workshops to shape UI text and help content, then created comprehensive AWS getting started documentation in parallel. Both surfaces reinforced the same prerequisite requirements and deployment workflows.

**Weekly design workshops (Q4 2022):**

I participated in UX design meetings with PM, UX Designer, Console Developer, and Front-End Engineer, reviewing Figma mockups at early design stages and providing feedback on UI workflows and information architecture. These sessions enabled iterative refinement where I could identify gaps before designs were finalized rather than addressing issues post-implementation.

**Design feedback contributions:**

I identified information gaps in the PM and designer's proposed UI text, particularly around Marketplace dependencies, Service Quotas requirements, and ELB functionality. Many customers coming from on-premises OpenShift environments were unfamiliar with these AWS service integrations. My feedback influenced console design language and element choices through multiple design review cycles.

I also suggested UI text improvements for accessibility and inclusivity. The original text contained jargon and assumed AWS expertise. I rewrote content to explain concepts like Marketplace integration, Service Quotas purpose, and ELB role necessity in simpler terms while maintaining technical accuracy.

**Iterative refinement process:**

The PM and UX Designer drafted initial UI text based on feature specifications. I rewrote this content to simplify language and improve scannability, then shared revisions through collaborative review cycles with PM, UX, and Console Dev. Our editor provided final polish before implementation. This collaborative process ensured UI text addressed customer needs while aligning with technical constraints.

**Help panel strategy:**

I created help content from scratch for this net-new console experience. Each help panel was contextualized at the appropriate depth for its specific prerequisite type. Rather than explaining everything in the console, help panels linked to detailed documentation for customers needing deeper technical guidance, creating a natural path from console to comprehensive AWS documentation.

## Designing the Console Experience

### UI Text and Automated Validation

The prerequisite wizard required UI text across multiple interaction points: step instructions, status messaging for each validation check, error messaging with actionable next steps, explanatory text for why each prerequisite matters, and simplified technical language for complex AWS service dependencies.

**Key UI text improvements:**

The original PM/designer text contained jargon and assumed AWS expertise that OpenShift administrators might not have. I rewrote content to improve accessibility by explaining Marketplace integration (why ROSA uses AWS Marketplace for billing), Service Quotas purpose (preventing deployment failures from insufficient capacity), and ELB role necessity (load balancer management for cluster traffic).

I simplified headings and descriptions for scannability, ensuring customers could quickly understand validation results without reading dense paragraphs. All content used standard AWS service naming conventions to maintain consistency with other AWS documentation customers already knew.

### Help Panel Content

I created a help panel system from scratch for the prerequisite wizard, covering ROSA Enablement overview (what the wizard checks and why), Verify Prerequisites (how automated checking works), AWS Account Requirements (IAM roles and trust policy setup), Service Quotas (EC2 instance limits, EBS volumes, Elastic IPs), ELB Service-Linked Roles (why load balancer roles are required), and AWS and Red Hat Account Connection (Marketplace integration explanation).

**Help panel design principles:**

Help panels appeared contextually at the point of customer need rather than requiring navigation away from the task. Content was concise, addressing specific information gaps without overwhelming customers with unnecessary details. Each panel included actionable next steps, linking to detailed documentation for resolution guidance when validation checks failed.

## Designing the Documentation Experience

### Creating AWS-Native Getting Started Resources

While developing console UI text, I created comprehensive getting started documentation for the AWS ROSA User Guide through Q3 2022. This addressed the documentation gap customers experienced when looking for prerequisite and deployment information on docs.aws.amazon.com.

**Docs-as-product approach:**

Documentation was designed as part of the complete enablement surface, reinforcing terminology and prerequisites introduced in the console wizard. Console help panels linked to detailed documentation; documentation reflected console validation checks. This connection ensured customers experienced consistent guidance whether they started in the console or documentation.

**Cross-company collaboration:**

I worked with Red Hat documentation writers to ensure a unified Day 1 narrative spanning both AWS and Red Hat documentation sets. This collaboration ensured both platforms used consistent AWS service terminology, reducing cognitive load for customers navigating multiple documentation sources during deployment. We aligned on how to describe Service Quotas, IAM requirements, and ELB roles so customers wouldn't encounter conflicting information.

/>

**Information architecture decisions:**

I created a getting started landing page directing customers to the appropriate workflow for their use case (CLI-based vs PrivateLink-based deployment). A separate set-up page surfaced all prerequisites in one location, making it easy for customers to verify readiness before beginning deployment. Workflow-specific deployment procedures provided step-by-step guidance tailored to each approach.

Prerequisites documented in the set-up page aligned exactly with console wizard validation checks, creating a consistent story. Customers could validate prerequisites in the console, then reference detailed configuration steps in the documentation without encountering conflicting information about what was required.

**Console and documentation connection:**

Console help panels linked directly to relevant sections in the set-up documentation, providing a clear path from automated validation to detailed configuration guidance. Both surfaces used consistent AWS service terminology, so customers didn't need to mentally translate between different naming conventions. Customers could self-service through the console wizard, then reference documentation for detailed procedures when needed.

## Impact and Outcomes

### Cohesive AWS-Native Enablement Experience

The coordinated console and documentation experience shipped in Q4 2022, creating ROSA's first complete AWS-native enablement path. The prerequisite automation wizard passed Fit n' Finish UX review on first submission, validating the approach of developing UI text through embedded weekly workshops rather than post-design retrofitting.

The documentation filled a customer-identified gap, providing prerequisite and deployment guidance customers expected to find in the AWS ROSA User Guide. Customers could now discover all necessary information on docs.aws.amazon.com, eliminating the friction of hunting across partner documentation sites for foundational enablement information.

This foundation became the base for subsequent ROSA features, including the 2023 HCP billing integration that built upon the same prerequisite validation and documentation framework. The patterns established for automated prerequisite checking and coordinated console-documentation development became the template for future ROSA console work.

## Key Takeaways

### Console and Docs Are One Experience

Customers don't distinguish between console and documentation when trying to enable a service. They're navigating a unified product experience. Designing console UI and documentation together created better outcomes than treating them as separate deliverables that happen to reference each other. When prerequisites aligned across both surfaces, customers experienced less cognitive load and fewer contradictions.

### Meet Customers Where They Expect to Find Information

ROSA customers expected to find prerequisite and deployment documentation in the AWS ROSA User Guide, not exclusively on a partner site. Their experience with other AWS services set this expectation. Meeting customers where they naturally looked for information positioned ROSA more clearly as an AWS-native service and reduced navigation friction that could have discouraged adoption.

### Embed Early to Influence Design

Weekly workshop participation enabled me to identify information gaps and suggest UI improvements before designs were finalized. I could propose simplifications and terminology changes when they were still easy to implement rather than after console code was written. Being in the room when design decisions happened was more valuable than reviewing completed mockups where changes would be costlier.

### Consistent Terminology Reduces Cognitive Load

Coordinating with Red Hat writers ensured consistent AWS service terminology across both documentation platforms. When customers navigated between AWS and Red Hat resources during deployment, they encountered the same language describing Service Quotas, IAM roles, and ELB requirements. This reduced confusion and made both documentation sets more trustworthy as sources of accurate information.
