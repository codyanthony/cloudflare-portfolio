title: EVS Day 1 Deployment Experience (Console + User Guide)
description: Creating integrated console workflows and deployment documentation for VMware Cloud Foundation on AWS
---

import { Card, CardGrid, Aside, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This project demonstrates integrated console UX and deployment documentation for Amazon Elastic VMware Service (Amazon EVS), an AWS platform that enables enterprises to migrate VMware-based workloads to the cloud without re-architecting applications. I created console UI text, 28 help panels, and deployment documentation from scratch as integrated components of a unified Day 1 experience, shipping on schedule with the service's general availability launch.

The work spanned private preview, public preview, and general availability launch. I collaborated with EVS product, UX, engineering, and solution architect teams to address complex networking requirements, DNS validation friction identified during public preview, and cross-service documentation coordination across AWS and VMware components.

## The Challenge

### Reducing Day 1 Friction for VMware Workload Migration

Amazon EVS enables enterprises to migrate VMware-based workloads from on-prem to AWS. Enterprise customers increasingly required flexible, customer-managed cloud alternatives to modernize their VMware workloads. However, the standard VCF deployment experience can involve manual processes with multiple friction points. Amazon EVS needed to simplify VCF deployment while supporting complex networking requirements to ensure successful customer adoption.

**Complex networking requirements:**

- BGP routing configuration with VPC Route Server
- VLAN subnet allocation across 10+ network types
- Cross-service dependencies with VPC, IPAM, Service Quotas, Route 53
- Coordination requirements between AWS and VMware components

**DNS validation friction:**
Early customer testing revealed a deployment barrier: free-form DNS hostname inputs with no console-side validation were a significant source of configuration friction. Customers frequently entered invalid hostnames that resulted in validation failures late in the provisioning workflow, requiring them to restart the setup process and impacting first-deployment success rates.

**Knowledge gaps:**
VMware administrators migrating to AWS needed contextual guidance bridging on-prem VMware concepts with AWS service integration patterns.

## Addressing DNS Validation Friction

### Coordinated Console and Documentation Fixes

When public preview customer feedback revealed DNS validation as a primary friction point, I worked with PMs, UX, and engineering to address the issue across console and documentation surfaces.

**Console improvements:**

- Page introductory text explaining DNS hostname requirements and where to configure DNS records (VPC DHCP option set)
- Info callout clarifying constraint that confused customers (enter hostname, not FQDN) with link to detailed user guide topic
- Two contextualized help panels: "Management appliance DNS hostnames" explaining DNS configuration requirements, and "Confirm and Continue" guiding customers through validation checkpoint
- Field-level instructional text and validation error messaging ("Hostname is required")
- Confirmation checkbox with acknowledgement text that hostname inputs match DNS records (required to ensure alignment with custom DNS provider configurations)

**Documentation improvements:**

Major revisions across Getting Started and Setting Up pages, shipped with GA launch:

- Expanded [DNS configuration requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/evs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#getting-started-config-dns-ntp-dhcp)
- Added [DHCP options set configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/evs/latest/userguide/setting-up.html#vpc-dhcp)
- Enhanced [deployment prerequisites checklist](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/evs/latest/userguide/evs-deployment-prereq-checklist.html) surfacing DNS requirements earlier

These coordinated updates addressed high-priority customer feedback identified by business leadership in weekly reviews.

## Complete Console and Documentation Scope

### Building the Full Day 1 Experience

Beyond DNS validation fixes, the project involved creating the complete EVS console and documentation experience. I led weekly console UI text workshops with PMs, UX designers, and console developers, providing feedback through multiple Figma design reviews that influenced overall design language and console element choices.

**Console UI text:**

- Wizard step instructions across 6-step environment creation workflow
- Form field labels and descriptions
- Error messaging for validation failures
- Success and status messaging
- Modal dialogs and confirmation flows

**Help panel system (28 panels total):**

- Main environments page overview
- Wizard-level guidance for each of 6 steps
- Field-level contextual help for complex inputs (VPC Route Server, VLAN subnets, DNS hostnames, VMware licensing)
- Troubleshooting guidance for common validation errors

The help panels addressed VMware admin knowledge gaps about AWS services. For example, the VPC Route Server help panel explained BGP routing requirements and peer ASN configuration. These concepts were familiar to network engineers but potentially new to customers migrating from on-prem VMware.

**Cross-functional collaboration:**

- Daily engineering syncs for API design input
- Weekly enablement meetings with solution architects gathering deployment pattern insights
- Weekly networking documentation syncs coordinating cross-service documentation
- Weekly business reviews reporting progress to product and business leadership

## Documentation Experience

### Deployment Documentation Enabling First Success

Simultaneously with console work, I created deployment documentation across private preview, public preview, and GA launch phases.

**Private Preview Documentation:**

- Getting started procedures
- Service overview and terminology glossary
- Architectural reference material
- Migration planning guidance

**Public Preview Documentation:**

## Impact and Outcomes

### Launch Success

Console, help panels, and documentation shipped on schedule through all three milestones: private preview, public preview, and general availability. Coordinated parallel launch across all EVS surfaces: user guide, API guide, CloudFormation, console, help panels, and documentation landing page. Post-GA work continued with major networking feature enhancements.

### Process Efficiency

The 28 help panels passed UX design review on first submission, validating the decision to develop UI text through embedded weekly workshops rather than post-design retrofitting. Early PM/UX/engineering alignment on DNS validation messaging enabled coordinated fixes across console and documentation without requiring separate review cycles for each surface.

### Customer Impact

DNS validation improvements addressed the root cause of deployment friction identified through early customer testing. The help panel system enabled self-service deployment for VMware administrators new to AWS. Documentation supported independent first deployments while solution architects remained essential partners in teaching complex VMware concepts and providing deployment pattern expertise.

## Key Takeaways

### Start with Customer Data

Deployment failure patterns weren't discovered until public preview customer testing. Building feedback mechanisms early (syncs with product/engineering and field teams, business reviews, Voice-of-the-Customer (VoC) data analysis) enabled rapid response when friction emerged.

### Console and Docs Must Solve the Same Problems

DNS validation required coordinated fixes across console (validation alerts, error messaging) and documentation (configuration guidance, prerequisites). Treating them as unified experience accelerated resolution.

### Embedded Participation Enables Rapid Iteration

Weekly workshops and daily engineering syncs meant I could contribute to DNS solution design rather than document decisions after the fact. Being in the room when product decisions happened accelerated both console and documentation improvements.
